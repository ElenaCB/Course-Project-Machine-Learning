# Course-Project-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the course project for the Practical Machine Learning class. Here we use the human activity recognition to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.
